List of pages we still need to do, I'm putting what I think we need and then some we could maybe add but it's not necessary:

Staff Registration (Nurse, Receptionist, Doctor)
Dashboard Views for each Staff User
Cancel/ Make Changes to Appt
View Scheduled Appt
Reminders Page:
- Messages
- Upcoming Bills
- Labs uploaded
- Prescription sent out
- Upcoming Appt.
Message & Alert Center
Notification Page
View Insurance Info
Make Payment
Pre-Screening by Nurse
Lab Result 


ONLY DOCTOR: Charts page (list of current & button/ page to create/import), Billing page change to view patients billing invoices (no billingInfo button, still have link through invoice ID#), Appointments change request to create & take doctor option off, Lab forms, Prescriptions order forms, appointment forms/ notes, health insurance, view patient history, excuses?

ONLY NURSE: pre-Screening, appointments, prescriptions, lab forms 

ONLY RECEPTIONIST: billing, appointments, health insurance
 
Fixes:
**general: move home buttons to left corner instead of right, maybe include a back button within the webpages, 
have addresses, card numbers, and emails be checked to be in the right format**
Signup Page: doesn't require an email address specifically, doesn't check the password fields match, proceeds to Welcome page with choice between Patient & Doctor (should just be patient option if at all) 
Alert Center: shows reminders/ notifications
Prescriptions -> Refill Request: make page 
Profile: have cards for different info = profile info (place to make updates), billingInfo, Lab Results, Patient History, Payments Made  
Calendar: be able to click on days & see availability, remove the "Free Calendar Widget" at the bottom?
Billing: link the billing invoice receipt to the invoice ID#
CreateBillingInfo: CVV is 3 digit only, when it is submitted go back to dashboard
View Messsage: show profile of messengers, include time delivered under message bubble?
Request Appointment: fix military time for the edit/ confirm popup
